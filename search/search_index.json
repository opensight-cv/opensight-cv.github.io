Outputs ( img = img ) There are already many useful modules included in OpenSight, but creating your own can add more complexity to your vision pipeline. The source code for the modules is located under opsi/modules in the opensight repo . Note that importing cv2 directly is discouraged. All new cv2 functionality should go into cvwrapper.py .","title":"Creating Modules"},{"location":"modules/#creating-modules","text":"Modules make up a great portion of OpenSight's functionality.
